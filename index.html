        <h1>OLA S1 Pro</h1>
        <p>Moving on to the fit and finish, the Ola S1 Pro we received came with panels with consistent gaps. Sure there is a bit of rattling 
          happening, and we think it is the front speakers which are not firmly tightened. Nevertheless, the rattle is emanating from the front apron. While some of the owners we know have been complaining about panel gaps, we have had no issues with our scoot. Now here is the thing. Ola needs to get its quality checks normalized. The other oddity we found was the charging port recess. The hatch is not lockable, and it should have been. This will also allow people to play with it when the scooter is parked and unattended.

        <h1>Tesla Model S</h1>
        <p>The fully electric Model S has an EPA estimated driving range of more than 400 miles, and the ability to use Tesla's supercharging network in public places is a major plus. Performance is exceptional, with quiet and thrilling acceleration, pinpoint handling, and a firm yet comfortable ride. The hatchback design aids versatility, and the frunk, or front trunk, is a bonus. But the controls are extremely unintuitive because Tesla has eliminated the steering-wheel stalks for the turn signals and wipers. Many common functions are performed through the yoke, which is a small, half steering wheel that brings serious compromises in usability and maneuverability. Instead of a side-mirror-based BSW system, the Model S displays images of cars in adjacent lanes within the instrument cluster which is a poor substitute.</p>

      <h1>Tesla Model 3</h1>
      <p>  The 2023 Model 3 is a very good car. In addition to three potent and fuel-efficient electric powertrain options, this Tesla handles well and boasts an impressive driving range. The interior is simple but elegantly designed, and the front seats are spacious and comfortable. Cargo space is above average for the luxury electric car segment. This Tesla's main downsides are a tight second row and a complex and often distracting infotainment system.</p>

      <h1>Tesla Model X</h1>
      <p>  The Model X comes standard with a battery large enough to cover a claimed 269-mile driving range but the Long Range model comes with a battery that can go for up to 348 miles of driving per charge; upgrading to the faster Plaid model drops the estimated driving range to 333 miles. Recharging is quick via one of Tesla's Superchargers, which are located across the country. Charging at home via a 240V or 120V connection will be slower, but probably more convenient for owners, so Tesla offers in-home charging equipment for purchase.</p>

      <h1>Tesla sees critical supplier get snatched up by GM</h1>
      <img src="teslanews.webp">
      <p>Tesla has seen one of its critical suppliers for its gigacasting technology, TEI, being acquired by General Motors.

        </p>
      <p>
        Tesla has been pioneering the use of bigger cast parts in its vehicle bodies over the last few years.
        
        It started by replacing 70 rear body parts with 2 giant ones in Model 3 and since then, it has progressed into producing Model Y bodies with just a few parts produced by giant casting machines.
        
        After being skeptical at first, the rest of the industry has started to follow with similar efforts.
        
        </p>
      <p>
        Now we learn that GM is also dipping its toes in the space and it is directly affecting Tesla by doing it.</p>

      <h1>ZEEKR shares first interior images of its 007 sedan ahead of pre-orders this week</h1>
      <img src="news2.webp">
      <p>Things continue to move quickly for ZEEKR’s fourth EV model, the 007 – which is due to begin pre-orders in China before week’s end. After sharing images of its first sedan last week, ZEEKR has followed up with our first look at the 007’s interior, along with some new exterior pics. See more below.

        ZEEKR remains a relatively young EV automaker out of China that is expanding at an impressive rate that, so far, has the sales to back it up. We’ve already seen the Geely-owned automaker deliver the 001 shooting brake, as well as a new quad-motor FR version.</p>
